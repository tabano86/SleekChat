# SleekChat v2.0

SleekChat is a complete overhaul of the classic WoW chat UI addon. Our goal is to modernize the chat experience with:
- **Dynamic Tab Management:** Add, remove, and rename chat tabs on the fly.
- **Robust Channel Routing:** Ensure messages (including system and combat logs) are properly routed to their corresponding tabs.
- **Clean UI Enhancements:** The input bar remains hidden until activated, chat windows are fully resizable, and settings icons are embedded inside the chat window.
- **Improved Slash Commands:** Slash commands now work reliably with the new UI.
- **Additional Enhancements:** Over 20 UI/UX fixes including refined message filtering, better moderation, integrated notifications, and more.

## How It Works

SleekChat v2.0 is built on Ace3 libraries. The modular design splits functionality into core components, configuration, events, messaging, tabs, notifications, etc. This design makes the addon highly configurable and extensible.

## Installation & Usage

1. Copy the addon folder into your `Interface/AddOns` directory.
2. Launch WoW and type `/sleekchat` to open the settings panel.
3. Use the in‑game configuration to create, remove, or rename tabs and adjust channel routing.
4. Enjoy your modern, production‑ready chat interface!

## Future Improvements

Planned enhancements include further UI refinements, additional integration options, and advanced messaging features.
