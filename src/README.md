Below is an updated README that not only describes the feature set and integration strategy for SleekChat v2.0 but also outlines the overall project architecture, directory structure, and considerations for extensibility, CI/CD, and modularity. This design is intended to support a robust, maintainable addon that can grow over time while strictly remaining within the WoW Classic API and Blizzard policies.

**SleekChat v2.0 â€“ Enhancing WoW Classic Chat (Not Replacing It!)**
===================================================================

SleekChat v2.0 is a modular, lightweight addon that builds on top of WoW Classicâ€™s default chat system. Our goal is to extend and enhance the existing chat functionalityâ€”improving dynamic tab management, filtering, advanced linking, and many other qualityâ€‘ofâ€‘life featuresâ€”without replacing the builtâ€‘in chat app. By using approved API hooks and a modular architecture, SleekChat integrates seamlessly with the default system and with popular addons like Prat 3.0, WIM, and BadBoy.

* * *

**Core Goals & Integration Strategy**
-------------------------------------

*   **Enhance, Donâ€™t Replace:**

    *   **Default Chat Preservation:** Our addon hooks into existing chat frames to add new features while keeping all native behaviors intact.
    *   **Seamless Hooking:** Features such as advanced linking, smart filtering, and dynamic UI adjustments overlay the default system using Blizzardâ€‘approved API calls.
*   **Policyâ€‘Compliant Enhancements:**

    *   All data and functions use inâ€‘game APIs, saved variables, and approved UI modification methods.
    *   No automated messaging, external data transfers, or violations of Blizzardâ€™s secure frame rules.
*   **Automatic Settings Persistence:**

    *   User settings (tab layouts, filters, themes, linking preferences, etc.) are stored in saved variables and automatically migrated across updates.
    *   Integration with other addons is autoâ€‘detected at startup, eliminating manual configuration via slash commands.

* * *

**Project Architecture & Structure**
------------------------------------

To ensure extensibility and maintainability, each feature group is developed as a separate module. This modular design allows for independent development, testing, and CI/CD integration.

### **Languages & Technologies**

*   **Lua:** Primary scripting language for WoW addons.
*   **XML:** Used for defining UI layouts and frames.
*   **YAML/JSON:** For CI/CD configuration (e.g., GitHub Actions).
*   **Documentation:** Markdown files for developer and user guides.

### **Extensibility & CI/CD**

*   **Modular Development:** Each module resides under `Modules/` and is designed to be independent. New features can be added as separate modules and integrated via a central configuration.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:**
    *   **GitHub Actions:** A CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs linting (using Lua linters) and basic tests (if applicable) on each push to ensure code quality.
    *   **Automated Tests:** Where possible, nonâ€‘UI logic is unit tested.
*   **Documentation:** Detailed architecture and feature-specific documentation are maintained in the `docs/` directory.
*   **Versioning:** Semantic versioning is applied, and release notes are generated to track changes, including migration of user settings between updates.

* * *
