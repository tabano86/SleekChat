Below is a revised, more “director‑style” README that amplifies each section with abundant yet feasible features. We’ve added new bullet points and details throughout, ensuring these enhancements remain within Blizzard’s WoW Classic addon policies and leverage the approved API. Think of this as SleekChat v2.0 “Extended Director’s Cut.”

* * *

**SleekChat v2.0 – Enhancing WoW Classic Chat (Not Replacing It!)**
-------------------------------------------------------------------

SleekChat v2.0 is a modular, lightweight addon that builds on top of WoW Classic’s default chat system. Our aim: **empower** every player with a richer, more intelligent chat experience—without breaking or replacing Blizzard’s built‑in chat. Picture seamlessly overlapping features such as **dynamic tab management**, **smart filtering**, **advanced linking**, and a suite of quality‑of‑life improvements, all **within** policy. By weaving together carefully designed modules and strict adherence to Blizzard’s APIs, SleekChat integrates with popular addons like Prat 3.0, WIM, and BadBoy with minimal user friction.

* * *

**Core Goals & Integration Strategy**
-------------------------------------

1.  **Enhance, Don’t Replace**

    *   **Default Chat Preservation:** We hook into existing chat frames, adding layers of functionality while preserving native behaviors.
    *   **Seamless Hooking:** Our advanced linking, filtering, and UI adjustments are overlaid via Blizzard‑approved API calls, ensuring minimal conflicts and maximum stability.
2.  **Policy‑Compliant Enhancements**

    *   **In‑Game APIs Only:** All data storage (saved variables) and function calls use Blizzard’s documented UI methods.
    *   **No Automation or External Transfers:** SleekChat never sends automated messages or offloads data outside of the game.
3.  **Automatic Settings Persistence**

    *   **Saved Variables:** User preferences for layout, filters, and themes are stored automatically.
    *   **Auto‑Detection of Other Addons:** On load, SleekChat looks for installed addons (e.g., Prat, BadBoy), enabling relevant integrations without manual slash commands.

* * *

**Key Feature Categories (All Within the Chat Domain)**

* * *

**Project Architecture & Structure**
------------------------------------

We’ve kept a **modular design** at the heart of SleekChat. Each feature category is its own “module,” letting you enable or disable entire functionalities without risking conflicts or bloat. This approach is also perfect for continuous integration and future expansions.

### **Languages & Technologies**

*   **Lua:** Primary scripting for WoW addons.
*   **XML:** UI layouts, frames, and basic event handling.
*   **YAML/JSON:** For CI/CD configuration (e.g., GitHub Actions).
*   **Markdown:** Developer and user documentation.

```

### **Extensibility & CI/CD**

*   **Modular Development:** Each feature group lives in its own folder under `Modules/`. Additional or experimental features can be dropped in as new modules.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:**
    *   **GitHub Actions:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` handles linting with LuaCheck (or similar) and runs basic logic tests.
    *   **Automated Tests:** Core logic is tested where possible. (UI elements are typically tested manually or via specialized test harnesses.)
*   **Documentation:** `docs/` directory houses technical and user guides, including step‑by‑step instructions for module creation or integration.
*   **Versioning:** Uses semantic versioning (e.g., `2.0.1`, `2.1.0`) with release notes detailing changes.

* * *

**Installation & Setup**
