# LibDeflate

## Pure Lua compressors and decompressors with high compression ratio using DEFLATE/zlib format.

Copyright (C) 2018 Haoqian He

## Introduction

LibDeflate is pure Lua compressor and decompressor with high compression ratio, which compresses
almost as good as [zlib](https://github.com/madler/zlib). LibDeflate does not have any dependencies except you need to
have a working Lua interpreter.

## Supported Lua Versions

LibDeflate supports and is fully tested under Lua 5.1/5.2/5.3, LuaJIT 2.0/2.1,
for Linux, MaxOS and Windows. See the badge on the top of this README for the test result.

## Documentation

[Documentation](https://safeteewow.github.io/LibDeflate/) is hosted on Github.

## Limitation

Though many performance optimization has been done in the source code, as a pure lua implementation, its speed is
significantly slower than a C compressor. LibDeflate aims to compress small files, and it is suggested
to not compress files with the order of several Megabytes. If you need to compress files hundreds
of MetaBytes, please use a C compressor, or a Lua compressor with C binding.

## Performance

Below is a simple benchmark compared with another pure Lua
compressor [LibCompress](https://www.wowace.com/projects/libcompress).

The size of [The input data](https://gist.github.com/SafeteeWoW/d9770e08a6989032de01b7d61b53d981) is 158492 bytes. The
benchmark runs on Lua 5.1.4 interpreter.

NOTE: The compression method used by LibDeflate here is LibDeflate:CompressDeflate (Compress using raw DEFLATE format)

LibDeflate with compression level 1 compresses as fast as LibCompress, but already produces significantly smaller file
than LibCompress. High compression level takes a bit more time to get better compression.

## Download And Install

+ The [official repository](https://github.com/SafeteeWoW/LibDeflate) locates on Github.
  [LibDeflate.lua](https://github.com/SafeteeWoW/LibDeflate/blob/master/LibDeflate.lua) is the only file of LibDeflate.
  Copy the file
  to your LUA_PATH to install it.

+ To download as a World of Warcraft library,
  goto [LibDeflate Curseforge Page](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/libdeflate)

+ You can also install via Luarocks using the command "luarocks install libdeflate"

+ To use after installation, ```require("LibDeflate")``` (case sensitive) in your Lua interpreter,
  or ```LibStub:GetLibrary("LibDeflate")``` (case sensitive) for World of Warcraft.
